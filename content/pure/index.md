Gautam Chaudhuri, *Vortices and the Geodesic Approximation*

*Abstract:* The geodesic approximation models the dynamics of slowly moving solitons in a classical field theory by geodesics on a related moduli space, reducing complex problems in soliton dynamics to more tractable statements in Riemannian geometry.

In this talk I will introduce the geodesic approximation in the particular context of the dynamics of vortices in Abelian Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. We will begin with a brief overview of Abelian YMH theory and the existence of vortex solitons, moving onto the existence and structure of static vortex moduli spaces, and the validity of the geodesic approximation in the low-energy regime. The second half of the talk will focus on finer details about the vortex moduli space including the construction of the metric and some key geometric properties. Time permitting, we will mention some new results on how the vortex metric can itself be approximated in certain parametric limits.

Dylan Crook, *A self-adjoint endofunctor on the category of posets*

*Abstract:* The category of posets has partially ordered sets as objects, and monotone maps between them as morphisms. In this talk, we will describe a contravariant endofunctor on this category which takes a poset to its set of upper sets equipped with the inclusion partial order, and takes monotone maps to their inverse image maps, and we will show that it is self-adjoint on the right. This mirrors the contravariant powerset functor on the category of sets, which is similarly self-adjoint on the right - in fact, the powerset functor factors through the upper set functor we are describing. We will also look at some of the combinatorial applications of this adjunction, and, time permitting, we may discuss some other properties of this functor.

Anup Anand Singh, *Geometry of coadjoint orbits*

*Abstract:* Orbits of the coadjoint action of a (finite-dimensional) Lie group on the dual of its Lie algebra — called coadjoint orbits — are interesting geometric objects that carry a canonical symplectic structure. This talk will be an introduction to this point of view on a coadjoint orbit as a symplectic manifold, that is, a manifold equipped with a nondegenerate closed 2-form.

In particular, we will discuss a theorem, originally due to S. Lie and rediscovered in the 1960s by A. Kirillov and B. Kostant, that shows that the symplectic leaves of a Lie-Poisson structure coincide with the orbits of coadjoint representation. We will also briefly discuss how these ideas connect to the geometric formulation of classical mechanics where coadjoint orbits appear as natural phase spaces of dynamical systems.

Hope Duncan, *An introduction to large cardinals.* 

*Abstract:* Large cardinals are an important aspect of modern set theory, allowing us to expand our understanding of infinite cardinals, and providing a rich hierarchy with applications in many areas of mathematics. We will provide the necessary background to understand what large cardinals are, look at the assumptions needed to produce a wordly cardinal, and show that this is independent from ZFC. We will then look at the applications of Large Cardinals within set theory and beyond.

Mervyn Tong, *Finite combinatorics for the win*

*Abstract:* One fine morning, as you walk past Henry Price, a geothermal borehole driller excitedly beckons you over. 'What is it?' you ask. 'Did you find geothermal energy?' 'What? No, but I can see why you might think that,' he replies. 'I found this bounded subset of Euclidean n-space, and I want to break it up into pieces of smaller diameter. How many pieces do you think I would need? Would n+1 suffice?'

This is precisely the content of Borsuk's Conjecture, which has a surprising resolution using finite combinatorics. We present some notions and results in the theory of set systems, culminating in the beautiful proof of the Frankl-Wilson Theorem on modular intersections, and apply it to help out our driller friend.
