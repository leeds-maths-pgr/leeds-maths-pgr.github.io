## Autumn Term{#autumn}


### 30 Sep{.talk-date}
#### [Gautam Chaudhuri]{.speaker-name} — [2-Vortices on Elliptic Curves]{.talk-title} {.speaker-title}

*Abstract*: Vortices are topological solitons arising in the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity.
They have been observed experimentally and explain some of the magnetic properties of type-II superconductors.
A remarkable feature of low-energy vortices is that they can be completely described by algebro-geometric data.
Moreover low-energy vortex dynamics can be described by the path of a point in a high dimensional _moduli space_ which parametrises all possible data.

In this talk, I will introduce moduli spaces in the context of 2-vortices on elliptic curves.
After a brief review of some algebraic geometry, we will construct the moduli space of 2-vortices on an elliptic curve and show that it is a fibre bundle.
Time permitting, we will discuss some recent results on approximations to low-energy vortex dynamics and construct exact solutions for approximate 2-vortex motion on an elliptic curve.


### 07 Oct{.talk-date}
#### [Giorgio Genovesi]{.speaker-name} — [Showing Problems are Undecidable by Coding the Halting Problem.]{.talk-title} {.speaker-title}

[**NOTE THE CHANGE OF ROOM: ROGER STEVENS LT 15**]{style="color: red"}

*Abstract*: We go over some basic results of recursion theory and the undecidability of the halting problem. We then lay out a standard proceedure used to show that a problem is undecidable and prove a few classic examples.


### 14 Oct{#next .talk-date}
#### [Benji Morris]{.speaker-name} — [What's the Deal with Cellular Algebras]{.talk-title} {.speaker-title}

*Abstract*: A cellular algebra is an (associative and unital) algebra with a specified basis, defined by certain multiplicative properties. This notion was crystallised by Graham and Lehrer in the late 90’s in what has proven to be a popular work in modern representation theory. In this talk we will present this notion and its representation theoretic consequences, all while following a friendly example for concreteness.
